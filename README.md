# üî∑ axi4s-bicubic-upscaler

##  Introduction

This repository provides a **hardware-optimized bicubic interpolation IP** designed for real-time image scaling on FPGA or ASIC platforms. The core is built on the **AXI4-Stream protocol** and supports full backpressure through `tvalid`, `tready`, `EOL`, and `EOF` signaling. After pipeline warm-up, the design achieves a **sustained throughput of 1 pixel per clock**, enabling seamless integration into high-throughput video pipelines without requiring full-frame buffering.

Unlike runtime-computed bicubic filters, this IP uses a **separable 1D 4-tap kernel model** to precompute 2D interpolation weights for each sub-pixel phase. These weights are stored in a **Q1.15 fixed-point 2D LUT** and accessed at runtime via a compact ROM (`bicubicWeightRom`). For each output pixel, a corresponding **4√ó4 input window** is prepared by the `imageRearranger_clamp` and `lineBuffer`, and the appropriate 16 weights are applied using a **single-pass 4√ó4 multiply-accumulate operation**. The core compute block, `BCU_array`, consists of **16 parallel compute units**, each responsible for one pixel in the output 4√ó4 tile ‚Äî allowing all 16 results to be calculated simultaneously based on the interpolation phase `(ix, iy ‚àà {0..3})`.

> üõ†Ô∏è Notably, this IP **does not use DSP blocks** for multiplication. Instead, all multiply-accumulate operations are implemented using **LUT-based multipliers with a two-stage pipeline**, ensuring consistent timing closure and efficient area usage, even on low-end FPGA devices.

The computed pixels are then packed and serialized through a dedicated output pipeline:

bicubicValueBuffer
‚Üí fifo_bram_quad_to_single_axi4s
‚Üí colPixelStream

which ensures proper timing alignment and emits AXI4-Stream output with accurate `EOL` and `EOF` flags. The default configuration implements **4√ó upscaling** (e.g., `320√ó180 ‚Üí 1280√ó720`) using **four interpolation phases** (`0`, `0.25`, `0.5`, `0.75`).

##  Architecture

The Bicubic Resizer accepts an **AXI4-Stream slave** input. The **Rearranger** uses **line buffers (√ó5)** to assemble a real-time **4√ó4 pixel window** per cycle (border **clamp**), and the **BCU Array (√ó16)** applies **phase-indexed 2D weight LUTs (Q1.15)** to perform a **single-pass 4√ó4 MAC**, generating a **4√ó4 output tile (16 pixels)** in parallel. The **Back Buffer** then packs and serializes the tile to an **AXI4-Stream master** output at **1 px/clk**, with accurate `EOL/EOF` markers and full `tvalid/tready` backpressure propagation. All multipliers are **LUT-based with a two-stage pipeline**‚Äî**no DSP blocks**‚Äîfor robust timing on low-end FPGAs.

- **Rearranger**: Line-buffer controller that reorders the incoming stream and provides a 4√ó4 window every cycle (border clamp).
- **BCU Array (√ó16)**: Each *Bicubic Compute Unit* computes one pixel of the tile using the **16 phase-selected coefficients** and a balanced pipelined adder tree with rounding.
- **Back Buffer**: Packs the 16-pixel tile and serializes to **1 pixel/clock AXI4-Stream**; asserts `EOL/EOF` and propagates backpressure upstream.

## üîÑ Rearranger ‚Äî 5-Line Buffer Ring
<img width="1280" height="720" alt="ÌîÑÎ†àÏ††ÌÖåÏù¥ÏÖò1" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/ad53c407-ccb8-4983-b549-45834c2f2488" />

The `imageRearranger_clamp.v` and `lineBuffer.v` modules form a **4√ó4 pixel window every clock cycle** directly from the AXI4-Stream input, without relying on `EOL` or `EOF`.  
**Line switching is driven entirely by internal counters**, and the EOL/EOF flags are handled separately in the **Back Buffer / colPixelStream** stage.

### Per-pixel operation
1. **Write path**: The incoming pixel (RGB24 packed in 32b) is written into the **WRITE bank** at column `x`, which increments from `0` to `W‚àí1`.
2. **Read path**: Four **READ banks** are accessed at column offsets `{x‚àí1, x, x+1, x+2}` (clamped at borders).  
   Each row produces 4 pixels, forming the full **4√ó4 neighborhood**.
3. **Output**: The 16 pixels (4 rows √ó 4 columns) are packed into `o_pixel_data_{r,g,b}[127:0]` and sent to the `BCU_array`.  
   The `o_pixel_data_valid` signal is asserted when the window is ready.
4. **Backpressure handling**: If downstream `tready = 0`, the write enable and address counters stall, maintaining window consistency.

### Line buffer rotation
When the horizontal counter wraps from `x == W‚àí1` to `0`, the module performs a **line buffer role rotation**:
- The current **WRITE** bank becomes the **bottom-most READ** bank,
- The oldest READ bank is reused as the new **WRITE** bank.

No data is copied ‚Äî only pointers are swapped. This ensures smooth line transitions without stalling the pipeline.

### Why 5 line buffers?
- Bicubic filtering needs **4 vertical lines** per output pixel.
- The 5th line allows us to **write the next row concurrently** while reading the current 4,  
  eliminating read-write contention and keeping **1 px/clk** throughput.
